 #MICRODOS Repository 
 
Do you know about the "MICRODOS Plan"?

Microdos,a software on Windows.It has its own command grammar,just like cmd,java and powershell.

Although Microdos have not have some detailed using way,but i am sure that it will be the powerful tool on your desk or the most convenient tool when you do anything ,and all of these will be come true in nearly future.

Although Microdos only based on Windows platform,but only in based on Windows platform,it will do it all best,If in this condition,its ability can over all tool that on the Internet.

Because of the code are depend on .net framework,so it can not out of Windows platform quickly and than achieve all platform supported.
 
It is just a small program for convenient batch processing and work. To facilitate updates, I have enabled a repository on GitHub. Thank you for your attention! Thank you!

I know it may sound boring, but there are still quite a few people in the world who encounter some troubles while using the WINDOWS operating system.

Of course, my program is aimed at some intermediate computer novices, so you don't have to be so troublesome when using certain system programs.

Presumably, many people should know about VMware's VMware Workstation virtual machine software (which allows you to build a virtual system environment on your computer). When you install the WINDOWS operating system in it, you may encounter situations where you cannot activate it. For your convenience, we added an activation program in the Vision 17.0 initially, which is also the main reason for developing this software.

I will open source the latest version of the software for everyone to use and learn from.

I hope it has a place to use.Thanks!
