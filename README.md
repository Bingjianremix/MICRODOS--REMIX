 #MICRODOS Repository 
 
Do you know about the "MICRODOS Plan"?
 
It is just a small program for convenient batch processing and work. To facilitate updates, I have enabled a repository on GitHub. Thank you for your attention! Thank you!

I know it may sound boring, but there are still quite a few people in the world who encounter some troubles while using the WINDOWS operating system.

Of course, my program is aimed at some intermediate computer novices, so you don't have to be so troublesome when using certain system programs.

Presumably, many people should know about VMware's VMware Workstation virtual machine software (which allows you to build a virtual system environment on your computer). When you install the WINDOWS operating system in it, you may encounter situations where you cannot activate it. For your convenience, we added an activation program in the Vision 17.0 initially, which is also the main reason for developing this software.

I will open source the latest version of the software for everyone to use and learn from.

I hope it has a place to use.Thanks!
